### DEV UPDATES

Ok everyone its time for Dev Update #2

I have recently installed the game engine Cocos2dx, the same one used to create KHUx, onto my laptop. After some failed attempls, I finally got it up and running. I'm currently starting to transfer KHUx files from my iPhone to my laptop, hopping to be able to work off of that. Once thats complete, I will start to move over the custom medals and the idea most of you gave me. Thank you all so much for the recent support,
-Light

@everyone Here we go
Dev Update 1/ 50000 (idk)
This update will be sort of a roadmap saying when I would like certain things to happen


Ver 0.1 (Beta) This wonâ€™t have that much probably just having the ability to pull, customize 2 - 3 keyblades, and fight raid bosses. I would like this to come out around mid summer of this year (2018)

Ver 0.2 (Beta 2) This will add in more keyblades, ability to link your account to twitter(hopefully). About a month or 2 after initial beta

Ver 0.3 (Multiplayer Beta) Most likely late fall (having to get money and all to pay for a server and stuff) this will add in partyâ€™s and will be testing union cross

Ver 0.4 (Final Beta(Hopefully)) this will be the final beta to fix some things and add in a majority of new things and yeah happy happy

Confirmed things: The daily medals, new pet system, more daily jewels, I donâ€™t remember the rest ðŸ˜‚
Also sry for the ping




### More info is soon to come!
